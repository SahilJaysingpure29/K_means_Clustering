# K_means_Clustering
By Kunal Deshmukh
🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning
This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a shopping mall to identify meaningful customer segments. By using unsupervised machine learning techniques such as K-Means Clustering, we categorize customers based on attributes like age, annual income, and spending score.

📁 Dataset:
The dataset used is Mall_Customers.csv, which includes:

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

🧠 Objectives:
Understand customer behaviors and purchasing patterns

Segment customers into distinct groups

Visualize these segments to help businesses with targeted marketing strategies

🧰 Technologies Used:
Python 🐍

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Scikit-learn for machine learning (K-Means clustering)

📊 Key Highlights:
Data preprocessing and visualization

Elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters

Cluster visualization using scatter plots

Business insights from customer segments (e.g., high spenders vs low spenders)
